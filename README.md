# advent-of-code

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Before running, you'll need to add in your own `input.txt` files to any specific days you want to run, or comment out the `input.txt` file reads in the `solution.spec.ts` files. Advent of Code request that puzzle inputs not be shared, so I have not included mine in this repo.

To run:

```bash
# Run all days
bun test

# Run a specific day
bun test src/2024/01
```
